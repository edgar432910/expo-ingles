# Good mornig Fiorella and classmate
# 1
# Today, I'm going to talk about water pollution?
water pollution, the release of **sobtanci**substances into **subsurfez**subsurface groundwater or into lakes,
streams, rivers, and oceans to the point where the **sobtanci**substances **interfer**interfere
with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems.
# 2
pollution water is water **hozz**whose composition has been changed to the extent that it is **an yusable**unusable.
it is toxic water that cannot be drunk or used for essential purposes like agriculture.
# 3
## Types and sources of water pollutants.
Water bodies can be **poludet**polluted by a wide **verayadi**variety of **sobtanci**substances,
including  toxic **quemicas**chemicals, heat, petroleum (oil),
. Several types of water pollutants are considered below. for example
domestic **suich**sewage, solid waste, sediment and petroleum pollution
# 4
## Solid waste.
The improper **disposal**disposal of solid waste is a **meyol**major source of water pollution. Solid waste includes garbage,
electronic waste, trash, and construction and demolition waste, all of which are **yenereted**generated by individual, commercial, institutional, and industrial activities.
# 5
## Solid waste.
In some places solid waste is intentionally dumped into bodies of water. Solid waste pollution is **damaying**damaging to the health of aquatic ecosystems and can harm wildlife directly. Many solid wastes, break down and **lich**leach harmful **kemicals**chemicals
into the water, making them a source of toxic .
# 6
## Petroleum (oil) pollution
Petroleum **ooiol**(oil) pollution occurs when oil from roads and parking lots is carried in surface runoff
into water bodies. Accidental **ooiol**oil **espiel**spills are also a source of oil pollution.
Oil **esles**slicks eventually move toward **shorr**shore, harming aquatic life and **damaying**damaging recreation areas

## Sediment

Sediment (e.g., silt) resulting from soil erosion or construction activity
can be carried into water bodies by surface runoff. Suspended sediment interferes
with the penetration of sunlight and upsets the ecological balance of a body of water. Also,
it can disrupt the reproductive cycles of fish and other forms of life, and when it
settles out of suspension it can smother bottom-dwelling organisms.

## Domestic sewage.

Domestic **suich**sewage is the primary source of **patoyens**pathogens . Because pathogens are **excreidet**excreted
in **ficis**feces,all **suich**sewage from cities and towns is likely to contain pathogens of some type, potentially
presenting a direct **tret**threat to public health.This endangers the quality of lakes and streams,
where high levels of **Ã³xiyen**oxygen are required for fish and other aquatic organisms to survive.
