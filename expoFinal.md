# Good mornig Teacher and classmate
Today, I'm going to talk about 
_1 How Important Technology is in Our Daily Lives?_
Technology has spread all over the world and people use it all the time.
It is no longer limited to work and in developed *sozàiris*societies, but any person,can use a cellphone, for example, to take pictures, send and receive them.
first thing
_2 IImproved Communication_
Technology helps us to keep in touch with people who are away from us. We use phones and computers to talk to them and even see them.
Technology provides the possibility of communication between many parties in different regions of the world very quickly
second thing
_3 Better Information Access_
it wasn’t so long ago that you’d have to take a trip to the library to find out more in-depth information about a subject. Now, you can find hundreds of thousands of web pages dedicated to pretty much anything you can dream of, from “*kroshet*crochet patterns” to “Roman history” .

_4 Virtual Social Lives_
Another *saismeq*seismic change in our lives has been the introduction of social media. This industry has progressed fast. Services such as TikTok, Instagram, and others now give us an insight into the waking lives of others in real time, whether they’re friends with a few followers, or celebrities with millions.
_5 Flexible Working_
With the pandemic, many had to *abend*abandon their offices and log on from their own residences.
. All this is made possible thanks to technological *advenment*advancements
That’s not to say working outside the office doesn’t have its challenges. But yet again, technological progress comes to the rescue, this time with remote working software.

_6 Smarter Health Tracking_
Another trend in technology has been the rise of fitness devices.
We’re far *bION*beyond the days when your “sports watch” could *mirly*merely record your lap time. We now have the ability to monitor our heartbeats , track and monitor exercise plans.
